# GoodBTS

--- Apologies for the guide still being incomplete. I'm short on time, but I will continue to work on this until I see it as acceptable. Give it a month or so! ---

The most complete and up-to-date repository for BladeRF and YateBTS compatibility.

After working through the various issues of multiple sources to implement YateBTS with the BladeRFx40, I decided to create this repository in order to assist other creators with their own implementation in a much more thorough educational guide. I will do my best to avoid gaps in implementation, and add educational pieces where I feel confident in my knowledge.

A big shoutout to all those who helped and assisted with this project. Giovanni Licamelli, Mohammed Islam, David Miller, "rtucker at Nuand.com", and "Ioana Stanciu at forum.yate.ro".
